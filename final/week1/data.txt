Background:
Nowadays, there is a trend about Vietnamese food in some big cities in Europe. Vietnamese food has many interesting aspects: various cooking methods, various ingredients and good health. I think that ‘s why many European people love Vietnamese food. Besides that, many Vietnamese people live and develop their career in Europe so they want to find real Vietnamese food. It ‘s both a chance and a challenge. One of the European cities which many Vietnamese people live is Amsterdam - a beautiful city of Belgium. We plan to open a Vietnamese restaurant in Amsterdam.

Problem:
As I said, there is a large proportion of Vietnamese population in Amsterdam. It means there are many Vietnamese restaurants. To challenge them, there are 2 key points: choosing location and delivering good quality. Many high rating restaurants are located in the same area of Amsterdam. I want to find a location which is suitable for opening Vietnamese restaurant but it ‘s better if there are less good restaurants in that location.
